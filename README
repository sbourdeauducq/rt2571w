RT2501U/RT2571W Wi-Fi driver for ultra-embedded devices

This driver enables the use of the low-cost RT2501U/RT2571W SoftMAC Wi-Fi cards on platforms with very limited resources.
It is particularily well-suited for cost-sensitive consumer electronic devices. This driver is currently used in mass production with the Nabaztag/tag devices (aka Nabaztag V2).
